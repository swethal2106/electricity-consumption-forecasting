Electricity consumption data was successfully analyzed and preprocessed.

Weather and time-based features were extracted to improve prediction accuracy.

Data visualization helped identify consumption patterns across different zones.

Machine learning models such as MLP and XGBoost were implemented.

Model performance was evaluated using MSE and MAE metrics.

XGBoost showed better accuracy compared to basic neural network models.

Feature importance analysis identified key factors affecting power consumption.

The project demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning in energy forecasting.
