1.Study the Project Background
Understand the concept of electricity  consumption forecasting.
Study how historical electricity usage and weather conditions affect power demand.
Outcome: Clear understanding of the problem domain and real-world importance.

2. Define the Problem Statement
“To develop a machine learning based system that forecasts electric power consumption using historical electricity and weather data.”

3. Set Project Objectives
Analyze historical electric power consumption data.
Study the impact of time and weather features on power usage.
Build a forecasting model for predicting future electricity consumption.
Improve energy planning and demand management.

4. Define Project Scope
Uses historical electricity consumption data.
Focuses on forecasting power demand for Tetouan city.
Implements machine learning models using Python.
Excludes real-time sensor data and hardware integration.

5. Analyze Dataset at High Level
From Kaggle:
Identify dataset attributes such as:
Date and time
Power consumption values
Weather-related features
Understand data size and format (CSV).
 No cleaning or coding on Day 1 – only understanding.

6. Select Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Environment: vs code
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

7. Plan the Forecasting Approach
Load and preprocess dataset.
Visualize electricity consumption patterns.
Train ML models (Linear Regression / LSTM / XGBoost).
Evaluate predictions using error metrics.

8. Day 1 Conclusion 
“On Day 1, the problem of electric power consumption forecasting was studied in detail. The project objectives, scope, dataset overview, tools, and forecasting methodology were finalized for further implementation.”
